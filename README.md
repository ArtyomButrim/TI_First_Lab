# TI_First_Lab

This work is an application that allows the user to encrypt text information
using the simplest encryption methods, such as the "Rotating Lattice Method",
"Column Method", as well as the"Vigenere Encryption Method".

To encrypt text information from a file, you must create clear the next text documents in the project directory:
Decr-Encr.txt, Decr-Encr2.txt, Decr-Encr3.txt, Encr.txt, Encr2.txt, Encr3.txt, Encr-Decr.txt, Encr-Decr2.txt, Encr-Decr3.txt

For the program to work correctly in the directory, you must use the 
Delphi 7 development environment.
